  "reasoning_content": "We need to define split_breathing variable likely path. Use gptoss_fim_examples. Probably: split_breathing = gptoss_fim_examples / \"breathing-split-silence.mp4\"? Actually in test_files gptoss has attribute split_breathing. So import gptoss_fim_examples but need gptoss? Maybe use from auto_edit.tests.test_files import gptoss. But only imported gptoss_fim_examples. Could construct path: split_breathing = gptoss_fim_examples / \"breathing-split-silence.mp4\". Return that. So code:\n\nsplit_breathing = gptoss_fim_examples / \"breathing-split-silence.mp4\"\n\nThat's it."
