Just added a new `text()` function in separate file
- went to use text message, instead of coloring lines with color codes
- gptoss not only figured out the new function signature...
  and how to correctly use it...
  it also identified the purpose of using it here
     (to show the reason why the scenario was rejected)...
     AND positioned the label next to the min in this case that triggered the rejection!
