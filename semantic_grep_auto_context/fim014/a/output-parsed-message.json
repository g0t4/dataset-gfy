  "reasoning_content": "We need to fill at <|fim_middle|> inside filetype_to_extension table. Likely mapping many filetypes. Look at earlier ext_to_filetype mapping; need reverse. Provide entries like lua = \"lua\"? Actually filetype_to_extension maps filetype to extension string. Include entries for known filetypes: sh->bash? but extension is \"sh\"? Actually earlier ext_to_filetype maps extension to filetype. So reverse: filetype_to_extension = { python = \"py\", csharp = \"cs\", markdown = \"md\", ... }. Need include others: javascript = \"js\", typescript = \"ts\", typescriptreact = \"tsx\", html = \"htm\"? maybe \"html\"? but earlier ext mapping uses htm for html. For consistency use \"htm\". Also \"lua\" = \"lua\". \"ruby\" = \"rb\", \"rust\" = \"rs\", \"scheme\" = \"scm\", \"haskell\" = \"hs\", \"clojure\" = \"clj\", \"coffeescript\" = \"coffee\", \"cfg\" = \"conf\", \"c\" = \"c\", \"cpp\" = \"cpp\"? ext hpp, hh map to cpp. So filetype \"cpp\" => \"cpp\". \"c\" => \"c\". \"go\"? not in list. We'll add common ones. Provide mapping entries matching earlier comment. Also include \"yaml\" = \"yml\", \"vim\" = \"vimrc\". \"json\"? not in list. Keep minimal. Implement."
