<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fill <|fim_middle|> inside get_language_for_current_buffer. Likely map other filetypes. Look at earlier mapping in get_filetypes_for_workspace. Provide common ones. Probably include lua, sh, etc. Minimal: add lua = "lua". Also maybe sh = "sh". Use snake_case. Provide entries.
Return code snippet: lua = "lua", sh = "sh", javascript = "js", typescript = "ts", etc. Enough.
Implement as lines within table.
