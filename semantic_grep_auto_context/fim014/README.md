Classic provide a list of mappings or other things that you need to "generate" code for

Type in the first mapping and then let AI handle the rest, i.e. via FIM in this case

scenario A) pasted the list verbatim inline in the FIM file.
scenario B) removed list from file, and see if RAG can grab some :) from same repo
   .... YEAH BUDDY! RAG FOUND EM!
