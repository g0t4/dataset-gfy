<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to add fields after first_min etc. Probably add: first_min_seconds, last_min_seconds, first_min_idx?, etc. Look at usage earlier: they set window.first_min_seconds and window.last_min_seconds, also left_speech_for_sure_done_seconds etc already defined. So need attributes definitions with types. In class GapWindow earlier fields: left_speech_for_sure_done_seconds, right_speech_about_to_start_seconds, first_min, second_min, then need first_min_seconds, last_min_seconds, maybe others. Search in code: they reference window.first_min_seconds, window.last_min_seconds. Also maybe first_min_idx? Not stored. So add those attributes.
Thus insert:
    first_min_seconds: float | None = None
    last_min_seconds: float | None = None
Also maybe other derived fields like left_speech_for_sure_done_seconds already defined. So implement.
