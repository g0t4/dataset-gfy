  "reasoning_content": "We need to return type for full_analysis. Likely similar to speech_analysis but also compute merged. Look at usage earlier: in detector_notebook they call speech_analysis then merge_close_speech_segments. full_analysis probably does both. Return AudioAnalysisResult. So signature: def full_analysis(path: Path) -> AudioAnalysisResult: and implement calling speech_analysis then merging and setting analysis.merged. Provide code."
