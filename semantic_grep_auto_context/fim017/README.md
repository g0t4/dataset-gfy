love that it guessed I wanted to apply the `shift`
and especially love that I typed "y_s = " and gptoss rightly suggested to start with "if" instead!
- I should double back to tooling that would either:
  - allow me to accept line to replace current line (instead of accept == insert only)... I'd only use this with gptoss when it isn't giving me just the middle to insert
  - OR even better, update my FIM prompt to be edit not just insert (like zed's edit predictions approach) to let it modify surrounding code too!

## dislikes
redundant else branch...
```python
else:
    y_s = y_s
```
perhaps intended as a placeholder/reminder to consider if something else should happen in else?
