<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fill y_s assignment, handling shift maybe? Probably convert to list? In similar code earlier, they did shift handling before plotting. Here shift already popped. Likely need to apply shift to y_s if shift is not None: y_s = [val - shift for val in y_s] or np.array(y_s)-shift. Let's implement: if shift is not None: y_s = np.array(y_s) - shift else keep. Need import numpy as np? Not imported. Could use list comprehension. Use shift variable. So:
if shift is not None:
    y_s = [val - shift for val in y_s]
else:
    y_s = y_s
Return. Write code accordingly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>    if shift is not None:
        y_s = [val - shift for val in y_s]
    else:
        y_s = y_s
