gptoss rocks at missing imports!!
- in this case, I used VIDEO_FPS constant (adde that below)
- it noticed that which is obscure! and then correctly setup an import for it!


Qwen2.5-Coder is awesome with imports too, but I must say gptoss seems to excel in obscure, missing imports in areas like this where qwen2.5coder might fail if it's my own modules

Anyways, this is a big reason why I enjoy gptoss for FIM!
- That said there are times when Qwen2.5-Coder does better with missing imports, notably IIRC when there's a big gap b/w the added code and the top of the file... though I haven't actually verified this behavior (gut feeling only)... and I know there are times in the past when I would flip back to qwen2.5-coder for its FIM when it was more reliable on imports
