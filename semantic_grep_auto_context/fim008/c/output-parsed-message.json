  "reasoning_content": "We need to fill assertion line: `assert window.first_min_seconds = <|fim_middle|>` likely should be `==` and a value. Compute first_min_seconds for this test. In this scenario: start(-20).flat(40) then .down(1) then .up(5).down(10)... Need to know how first_min_seconds is determined: first_min is first dip after start? After flat, first_min likely at the down(1) after flat, which is at hop index after initial start offset of 1 sec. start creates segment starting at 1 sec? In earlier tests start seems at 1.0 sec. So start(-20) gives initial value at 1 sec. flat(40) adds 40 hops flat, so first_min after flat is after down(1) which is one hop later. So first_min_seconds = 1.0 + (40 + 1) / 882? Actually first_min is the minimum rms value after start, which is after down(1) giving -21 maybe. The down(1) is the first min. So index = start hop offset? start creates first value at hop 0? In earlier test first_min_seconds approx 1.0 + 25/882 where 25 hops down gave first min after 25 hops. So start is at 1.0 sec, then down(25) gives first min at hop 25. So here down(1) after flat(40) gives first min at hop 40+1 =41. So seconds = 1.0 + 41/882. Compute 41/882 ≈ 0.0465. So value approx 1.0465. They likely use pytest.approx. So line should be: `assert window.first_min_seconds == pytest.approx(1.0 + 41 / 882)`.\n\nThus fill."
