this time it was two sets of calculations:
- first that I want 10/2 => -5 to 5 (range) ... this was easy it just adds complexity to the next one which was not easy
- then, curve is 10-(x/2)^2  (10 is start value, separate param passed to start(10)
    it got all 11 values right! from x=-5 to x=5 ... IMPRESSIVE!
    no tools/code runners
- FYI RAG was off for this run so no help from RAG
