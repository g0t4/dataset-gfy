TLDR turn my matrix into a CLI table (using rich)

great way to dissect data w/o 10 minutes building the table myself... how many times would you look into something if it weren't for the hassle that is formatting the data to consume?

ALSO => great example of how model isn't distracted by RAG matches that are not even needed for this request, nevermind they make up the bulk of the prompt!
