<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fill condition: if rag_client.rag_yaml and not <|fim_middle|>
Probably check rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled? Already earlier they checked M.rag_yaml.enabled. Here they want if rag_client.rag_yaml and not rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled then return. So fill with rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled. Actually not enabled means false. So condition: not rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled then return. So code line: rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled then? Wait they wrote "and not <|fim_middle|>" so need expression that is false when enabled true. So "rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled" would be true when enabled. They want not enabled, so "rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled" preceded by not already. So we need "rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled". Thus full line: if rag_client.rag_yaml and not rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled then return end? They only have if line, need body? Probably just return. But placeholder only the condition part. So fill with rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>rag_client.rag_yaml.enabled
