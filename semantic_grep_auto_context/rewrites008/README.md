one two punch! yanks (of class from matplotlib codebase)
+ RAG for what I already had setup to toggle its visibility!

FYI I really should find a way to semantic_grep into dependencies too
- would be cool if it were automatic, but...
- this will be language specific
- probably per project I can list deps in my rag.yaml
  - list other directories with a .rag dir to also query
- MAYBE... make this a tool that can be requested by FIM/REWRITES/etc if it thinks it needs more info
    - ALSO would be cool to allow web requests to docs of various dependencies
    - user could opt into the FIM w/ tools or Rewrite /tools to specify when the model can do this
      then let the model decide when to do it

OBSERVATIONS:
- I need to dedupe yanks (i.e. double yanks, even if not quite the same)
- I really like RAG matches on python classes... this is working out well to provide lots of context and with gptoss speeds its not even noticeable
