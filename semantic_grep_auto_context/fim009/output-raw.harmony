<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fill call to create_gap but typo reate_gap. Probably should be create_gap(windowed, analysis). windowed list? earlier they had left_speech, gap, right_speech.

So fill: create_gap([left_speech, gap, right_speech], analysis)<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>create_gap([left_speech, gap, right_speech], analysis)
