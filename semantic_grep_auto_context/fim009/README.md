look at how beautifully RAG pulled the definition of create_gap...
this is why I changed RAG to use the current line only during FIM... b/c more than that often confuses what is critically important
and w/ FIM it's often the first line that is what really matters as far as RAG matches are concerned


HAPPY RAG'ing!
