another one, two punch combo!

I am elated with how well RAG is working across both AskRewrite (inline assist) and FIM both with gptoss!

and look at how gptoss is spending time resolving ambiguity in what segment to plot (many choices)... this shows the value of the thinking models that attempt to find a "best" answer even if there is no way to say what the best is... to find slight benefits and resolve
