struggled with magic commands blowing up yapf (formatter)... so not being able to format any files with them in it (I use python scripts as notebooks in iron.nvim).. and so with magic commands I lose the ability to format any of the notebook... b/c yapf parses the python code w/o ignoring lines you mark as ignored... so there's no way to have invalid python code and still use yapf on any part of the file

TLDR... gptoss120b helped me realize I can just use the ipython APIs to do the same thing as a magic cell and in my testing, I validated it works for this autoreload use case at least


having a local model that can answer questions, in this case w/o even a web search tool, is incredibly useful


btw... the thank you is to capture the last response in the llama-server logs as part of input messages... also, I prefer to thank machines if it means I don't forget how to say thank you (to humans)
