I had in mind building the abbr expanded value dynamically with ptw_path, not to have the abbr expand to use ptw_path... but I like the latter that gptoss came up with b/c I can then tweak that path later on... ableit at the same time it hides the ability to see and alter my ptw/pytest args... so we shall see which way I prefer... I can see a good argument for both (espeically for ptw_path at runtime, not abbr definition time) if my args to ptw/pytest are stable)

Great example of ambiguity... rarely is there one "right" way to respond to a given prompt... anyone using AI tooling must be aware that it is not "wrong" if the model intreprets a different request... that's no different than when a user asks for a feature and doesn't describe it in a way to help the developers implement what they want/need... NBD... and the upside is sometimes you get a solution that is better (or potentially better) than what you had in mind! (aka creativity)
