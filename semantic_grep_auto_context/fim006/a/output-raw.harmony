<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fill after setting window.first_min_seconds. Likely set window.first_min_rms = value etc. Look at GapWindow fields: first_min_seconds, first_min_rms, last_min_seconds, last_min_rms. So set rms values. Compute first_min_rms = all_rms_values[first_min_idx]; similarly last_min_rms later after last_min_idx_forwards. So insert line setting window.first_min_rms. Probably also set something else? At that point only first_min_seconds set, then later last_min_seconds. So add: window.first_min_rms = all_rms_values[first_min_idx]. Return.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>        window.first_min_rms = all_rms_values[first_min_idx]
