<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fill after setting last_min_seconds. Probably set last_min_rms. Look at GapWindow fields: first_min_seconds, first_min_rms, last_min_seconds, last_min_rms. So assign last_min_rms = all_rms_values[last_min_idx_forwards]. Return None. So code:
window.last_min_rms = all_rms_values[last_min_idx_forwards]
That's it.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>        window.last_min_rms = all_rms_values[last_min_idx_forwards]
