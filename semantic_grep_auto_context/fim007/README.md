So cool to see the model not only figure out what to add for this test case... that taper referred to the first_min/last_min value/timing
... but it also adjusted them to be just past the start of the silence gap for first_min and just before the end of the silence gap for last_min...
and I had my cursor in the wrong spot but it still suggested good code! I should've put my cursor after `)`...

anyways, cool to see so many factors come together to generate just what I hoped for!
