## bug fix workflow

had a bug in my command line chat viewer (python)...

from changes I made last night, threw it at gptoss, it came up with a good stopgap fix...

I then asked it to dig further as it indicate where the problem was at

it found culprit

I then asked it to fix the culprit, it did

then I asked to remove the stop gap (finally did)

last, commit
