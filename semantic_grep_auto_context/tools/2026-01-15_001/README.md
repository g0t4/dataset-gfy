wanted to look up a keymap in my fish shell config...

asked gptoss in agent mode (w/ tools)
+ semantic_grep tools

it found what I wanted right away!

only complaint, it had the answer in my auto context RAG matches! but, ran semantic_grep again and basically got the same results...
- TODO should I put the user request before the auto RAG matches again? I used to have it that way... not sure if that increases odds here or not... also NBD really b/c this was still so darn fast!

this is fun!

I am going to flesh out this workflow and maybe add some special features for it...
.. the ability to talk to my codebases, FRIGGIN AWESOME

on my own machine too

lightning fast
