very cool! gptoss had trouble with apply_patch on a multiline edit...
- and my prompt (system message) now suggests breaking down into smaller patches...
  gptoss switched to one line at a time! (1 abbr at a time) and that worked...
  I have never seen it do this many single line edits... that has to be due to my suggestion that you try smaller patch files if there are issues with bigger ones

yup it even says this after repeated failures!
> "Simpler: delete those lines individually using separate patches."
