freaky! I forgot where I left off last, what my general direction was on this repo... been busy for a few days, so I decided to ask gptoss to check most recent commits and tell me what it is that I was most likely going to work on next, wehre did I leave off... it found exactly what I wanted to do next and listed it as the top "guess" about what I intended to do next... imagine instead of a few days, imagine 3 months or a year... incredibly valuable to pickup where I left off... finally a way to put git commit history to use! besides the occasional git blame!
