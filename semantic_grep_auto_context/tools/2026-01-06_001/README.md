once again, no need to point where, just ask what I want and the model finds the spot... and this is matplotlib so it's not mission critical if this is not the "right" spot or "right" way to do this... in this case to hide toolbar



btw it looks like my thread export logic, after a first request/response, is duplicating the response message into the thread as well as into the response message (formerely "output.json")... I will have to fix that later
