I like describing this more than writing out the edge cases in code
=> model isn't coming up with solution, it's carrying out my thoughts
   cool thing is, if I change this later, I can always reuse prompt and expand it for 4+ cases!
=> good prompt with thoughtful explanation, goes a long ways toward good code from the model!
