again, just changing how plot works, segment plotter... to copy all critical points on shift click
... not only does this save me the time of copying the data I want...
... it also helps me not toil about how to present the copied data... it just picks a way, and if I don't mind, it's good to go!
    ... saves me a ton of time I'd waste hem hawing over how to display it when that doesn't often matter
    ... I am less attached to the format (and less offended) b/c I didn't come up with it!
    ... I only care to change it, if it isnt' working for whatever I thought I needed!
    ... especially valuable when I change this again, or throw this out, or don't use it!
quick prototypes of plots!


Aside, note that this single turn chat thread does not duplicate the last assistant message (final response for this turn)...
- indeed that is only happening on multi turn threads (i.e. if I follow up on this one)
