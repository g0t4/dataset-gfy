basically tasked gptoss with scraping my integration tests for a specific scenario (double humps) noted in comments and/or test code...
- then register them as labels here (it found several! but not all, that's fine too, I just wanted a jump start)
- also some of my notes were wrong or uncertain and so a few of these needed tweaks

look how RAG found the code needed! in the integration tests!
- it grabbed my monster test that covers a ton of scenarios, including double hump breathing scenarios

neat thing is, to understand my request at all (which was rushed/vague)... requires some level of understanding what is going on in multiple parts of the codebase
- and I believe that goes beyond mere statistics
- this IMO is proof of intelligence
- perhaps intelligence arises from statistics
