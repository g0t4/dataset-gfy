Discuss problem with segment plotter's ticks stopping at 30seconds
- I knew why, so I probably am steering the model a bit...

Nonetheless wanted to test its ability to find and modify using tools! Still floors me to see this work so well!
- And part of this is me just wanting to habituate using model for these tasks just so I can better get a feel for its strengths/weaknesses
- And help refine how I want to use this style of assistance going forward (vs inline assist, FIM, etc)
