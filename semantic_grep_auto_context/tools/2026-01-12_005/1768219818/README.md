ok this is a first!!!

had a rare, annoying bug

I guessed about culprit

on a limb, asked gptoss to find and fix it... gave it tools... it found and fixed it!

this is incredibly satisfying!

I didn't even provide the error message/stack trace (though I had it! I was lazy)

if I understand the bug, I don't have to fix the damn thing anymore! OR at least I don't have to hunt down the actual culprit, I can swoop in after the fact and make sure it's a solid fix :)

OMG! even better... RAG found the broken code, gptoss just had to fix it!!!
- my description alone pulled in the relevant code!!

Ok and the fix looks good so far!

ONLY problem, the same issue appears in the generic formatter and gptoss didn't fix it even though RAG match came back with it too!
