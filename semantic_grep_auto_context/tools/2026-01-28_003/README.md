wow ok so I am starting to get comforable deferring to the agent for some routine tasks, to save me time!
i.e. I wanted typescript snippets for tests.. I have them for javascript, so I just asked to replicate them in TS...
then I realized I want async variants too... asked for that to be added to both js and ts!
