RAG FTW... the model didn't even need to go find where to make the edits, the **automatic RAG matches already had the spots to change!**
- recall these are based on my prompt alone! think of them as an implicit tool call to semantic_grep (user requested)
   ... speaking of, THERE IS A TON OF VALUE IN LETTING USERS REQUEST TOOL CALLS TOO! (FOR "AUTOMATIC" CONTEXT)

Also, I ❤️ apply_patch tool w/ gptoss

this is stellar use of tools... this is actually what I had in mind for a next step... to pick items and show a label too!
- this is a great example I can now learn from and build upon
