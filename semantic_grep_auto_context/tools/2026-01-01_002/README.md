I am impressed with the ability to find the code to modify (via semangic_grep/embeddings)...
 and then to correctly modify it!

That said in this case I want something else, BUT this is a fair interpretation of my prompt...

Just baffling that I don't have to provide locations to modify! I just need to describe my request in a way that RAG is likely to find what I want! COOL!
