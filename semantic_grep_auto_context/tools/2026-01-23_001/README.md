faster than I can move them!
- it did change names but I like the new names
- so I asked it to update the zsh names to match

ahh now I see why.. I have abbrs setup but they are to functions _et ... it did mirror these names!
- wish it would've said, hey you already have them! and/or ask me to confirm what to do (keep / replace)
   - it did mention the existing ones in fish in a thinking section but then went right on to add them :)
   - TODO add a "Ask Wes to Clarify" tool?  clarify(question) tool!

then I realized I had them in fish already, as dynamic functions (to find current dir video to include)
- so I asked gptoss to rename the functions approach so they have exiftool in name to find easier in future
- and then to rollback the new fish abbrs

3 turns to tool use, worked out!

- stellar semantic_grep query! "abbr.*exiftool"
