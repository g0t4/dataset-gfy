back and forth session w/ gptoss syling the __str__ for GapWindow and NonSpeechGap
- even though some changes were trivial... it was fun just to describe each tweak and then I hopped over to my ipyhon instance which has autoreload setup (think hotreload) and re-ran a print to see the result
  ... crap I could've asked gptoss to do that for me lol and show the tool output!!!
   NEXT TIME!

HOT RELOAD is ESSENTIAL for VIBE CODING (regardless if small changs or huge)
