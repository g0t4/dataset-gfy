I just created a first_3mins.mp4 video to try a reproduction on a problem at 139s into FCPXML project...
anyways I wanted to use it and asked gptoss to update the various spots where first_10mins.mp4 was used
  and it got all 3 spots (one at a time) quickly
  following my requests!

and committing after each...

so damn cool!


yes, a simple request and change but the ability to carry it out is just neat b/c I can scale up the complexity of the request and that's gold
