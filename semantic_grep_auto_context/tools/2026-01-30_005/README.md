## test a simple find and modify md file

I am doing this to get a feel for using my tooling and the model to make changes...
- this is the change I can make obviously all on my own, still using my tools is worth learning better

for fun, asked gptoss to find and modify my system instructions for committing

to let the model know it is ok to reset/revert changes... so as to suggest that's fine
- that way model isn't always reversing via apply_patch when a `git checkout` or `git reset` would be way easier
