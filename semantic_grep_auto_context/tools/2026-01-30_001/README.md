interesting, gptoss is trying to run pytest tests! (finding no tests so far)

## philosophical

is there really a differnece between me knowing what the code looks like, but not typing it out... vs me typing it out?
- why not use models that can type out code w/o going file by file... BUT STILL MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THE CODE's ORGANIZATION, FRAMEWORKS, layout even, refactoring, etc

Think of agent/tools as copilot predictions but across a codebase
 - you still design the changes that will be applied then the tool goes to each spot and performs the insert
 - you review it still, just like with accepting a FIM prediction
