Interesting rejection here, initially gptoss did just part of my request and stopped claiming the rest was too much to do...
- It said to me "Let’s discuss a step‑by‑step plan if you still want to proceed."
    this makes me think if I gave it some sort of construct of a TODO list... or let it create one, that it might keep going!
    - Still super awkward to see it reject my request!!
- Then I asked it to keep going, it did a small part more but left other parts of my initial request outstanding
- Finally it did correctly say more work needed to be done to update callers!
    SO, key is it understood the request, which is great, it wasn't a trivial request in terms of what all it touched.
    and it even did small parts of it across two prompts from me...
    and it appear I could've asked it to continue...


## !!! TODO CHECKLISTs

TAKEAWAY I need a TODO list construct, ideas:
- pass check list with initial request
- put items in a checklist.md file?
- ask model to first break down steps... maybe prompt this with a /checklist slash command in the initial command (requires using a TODO tool call first?)
     could even force this by setting up the call in the assistant prefill in the initial prompt!
