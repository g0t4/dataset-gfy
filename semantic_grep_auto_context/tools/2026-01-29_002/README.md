without my prompt modifications that suggest using `fd` to find files, gptoss120b almost always uses `ls -R .` ... GAHHHHH
  ok i'll be honest... I had to threaten violence just to make sure it stopped using `ls -R` and it fucking uses `grep -R` alot too... FUUUUUUUUU
  I should try w/o threatning violence... that said, I had an old note and it never paid attention to it... but, maybe now, with the section on `fd` examples, that might be enough without threats of dead kittens :)... will have to run some evals to see
