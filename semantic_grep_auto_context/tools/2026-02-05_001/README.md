add jump to (goto) time in my segment plotter...
and then the insuing hot mess that is any sort of gui controls in python... resorted to macos dialog and it is PERFECT for what I want!
see back and forth on 3 or 4 diff ways to make the dialog!

impressive that it handles repeated editing of the same code region and no issues

then when it committed, it didn't include the other 5 files I had with outstanding changes!

THEN, had it extract a reusable module while I went down to make a bagel and get a monster... that's the part I love, I can describe the refactor, and walk away
