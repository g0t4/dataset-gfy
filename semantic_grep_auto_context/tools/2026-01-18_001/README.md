task gptoss with refactoring for me, it actually did a darn good job! followed my orders exactly... though I should probably not have explained the FIM consumers cuz I really wanted it to do the .content one layer further out... that's ok this matches verbatim what I asked for!

key thing is... people have to realize that AI will do what you ask, but what you ask might have multiple solutions... no reason to get upset when it gives a valid solution even if you wanted something else... JUST FOLLOW UP with the next step!
