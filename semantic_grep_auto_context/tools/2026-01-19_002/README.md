tagging gippity into the fight! go go go! ... added path param in blink of eye... I wouldn't even know where to look yet... like 10 minutes later I'd still be exploring, learning... instead I already opened a thread with it and symlinked my local repo to use dataset-gfy shared threads

had an issue with code `elseif` => `else if`... I pasted the error outta vite... and gippity fixed it in like 100ms

honestly, gptoss so far feels like using Sonnet 4.5 (at least for these smaller changes)... except way, way faster... I doubt gptoss will hold up to sonnet4.5 but we shall see... sonnet4.5 made several mistakes too with some basic tasks earlier today on this same app

OMG so cool!

other notes I am just noticing that RAG... ok so this repo is huge... my ask-openai.nvim repo has tons of different directions... and yet... the RAG matches for gippity's semantic_grep... every single one was in the /chat_viewer_web dir...
- that is just incredible
- and I dispatched the :AskQuestion command from a lua file, my web app has zero lua code in it... neat!
