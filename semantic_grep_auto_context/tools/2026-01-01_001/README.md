best way to see this is just the thread: `ask_thread_reviewer`

just for fun I threw a challenge to gptoss120b, I had update my zero_crossing_indices code and tests to return before_idx, whereas before it only returned after_idx
- I gave it /tools to use and it nailed it... this is not a trivial change for a model to make, super cool to see it find the one spot and make the correct updates!
