inline functions refactoring, did a good job, especially the wacky boolean logic! It correctly flipped logic around when inlining
- I love not needing to point at spots in code :)

AND it even committed the changes!!! finally!

only issues
- it left the original functions behind... I had to ask to follow up and remove those
- also a few times it tried to apply a blank patch file! lol! (first time failed, it tried again, then that failed and it was like "ok done"
- also other times it made it sound like it had changes to make, then did nothing and said it was done... interesting
