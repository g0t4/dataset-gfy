researching examples and want to dump rich.print(window.gap.crossovers) ... oh wait no repr!... NBD just ask gptoss tool use to go find it and do it... DONE

NOTE the RAG matches, the first one has the class... but that doesn't give after context...
- NBD b/c patch file just targets class as before context only... works great!
- Love that apply_patch doesn't need line numbers!
  - Love not needing to grep/sed for files
  - Love not needing to replace entire files
