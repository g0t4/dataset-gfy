love this workflow for plotting changes! and yeah I can polish this if I don't like it but dang it just gets me started in seconds instead of me fumbling around for 10 minutes deciding where to start and then like oh crap how is best to do this... when I don't care about all that and just wanna click to copy!

AskQuestion /tools when I click one of the min/max dots that I plotted as a part of crossover detection in mark_breathing... can I have it set_message() and copy to the clipboard

it works!
