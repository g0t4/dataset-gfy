part 2 - ask to replace toolbar message use w/ a text box
- note gptoss made an "Implementation steps" (checklist)
- clever use of top_k=1 (1 result) for `on_motion_notify_event(` and it got that back!
- several failures along the way, with context for patches... yet it kept trying and did check what was going on... I didn't check what caused them... only know that it produced working code when I reviewed changes.
