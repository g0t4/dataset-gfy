tool use => so darn satisifying to request WHAT w/o HOW (i.e. code to change)!
- same feeling I got when my neovim FIM (predictions/copilot) plugin was working well enough to use it for real code tasks!
- this approach of asking for help on small changes w/o pointing to the code to change, is as important as inline predictions (FIM) and inline assist (AskRewrite)
