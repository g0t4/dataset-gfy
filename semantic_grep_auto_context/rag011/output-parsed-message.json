  "reasoning_content": "We need to insert import or code before other imports. Probably need to import functions used: plot_segments, speech_analysis, merge_close_speech_segments, label_bounces, play_segments, AudioAnalysisResult, DetectedSegment, SegmentLabel. Likely from auto_edit.new_silence.detect import * already includes many. But need import matplotlib? Already later. The missing part likely defines __main__ guard? Actually after imports, they start using functions. So need to import plot_segments? That's in player.py. So add: from auto_edit.new_silence.player import plot_segments, play_segments. Also import types. Let's insert that."
