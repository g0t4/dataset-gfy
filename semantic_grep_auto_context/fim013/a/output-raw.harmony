<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to insert import statements? The <|fim_middle|> is at top of file. Likely need imports: import math, time, rich, numpy as np, sounddevice as sd, and type hints. Also definitions of AudioAnalysisResult, DetectedSegment, SegmentLabel. Probably just import statements. Provide code lines.
Return code to place at top. Include imports.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>import math
