  "reasoning_content": "We need to add method gate to TimeSeries. Implement similar to yanked snippet. Add method that sets values between lower and upper to 0? Actually gating: set values within range to 0? From snippet diff_stride2_gated: they copy, then set values where (neg_to_zero < values) & (values < pos_to_zero) = 0. So gate(lower, upper) should zero out values between lower and upper. Return new TimeSeries. Add type hints. Use copy_values then modify. Provide method inside class."
