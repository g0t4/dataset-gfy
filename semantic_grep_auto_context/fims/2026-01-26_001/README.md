incredible! I had some global state that changes for testing only and I caught the issue with a guard I added
then while I was thinking of how to fix it... my cursor was sitting next to a fix spot and the model spit out right what I was thinking at the same second I thoguht it!
this is a complex change here too.. all the relevant context was crucial to nail this one! and, it did!

without RAG match 4 ... not sure it would know that this was the "fix" or desired code... `get_gitignore_spec(fs_root_path, config):`
