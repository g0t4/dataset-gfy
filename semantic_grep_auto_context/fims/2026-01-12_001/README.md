love when FIM is paying attention in tests... and can help with tedius setup, assuming I have some data copy and pasted into the test case!
- and to be clear, this is not testing for testing's sake...
  so I am not expediting testing something that doesn't need tested (thus why I consider it tedious)
  Instead these are the critical tests to verify my detection logic works as I make changes to it
  I am TDDing minimal criteria so I can learn as I add more test cases
  TLDR... got a lot of useful tests to setup and I'd prefer to copy key data using my plotter
    and then let gptoss put that into test code I can verify
    will help me get more tests setup (w/o wanting to kill myself from tiny mistakes)
    which means I can quickly develop the last piece of the puzzle here which is deciding when and where to mute/noise gate!
    I already saw a huge win in my first updates for left_taper_end to my FCPXML generator, very exciting to see a few first tests resulted in way better cut logic!
      and that's with really minimal criteria that I would never have imagined would work...
      if it weren't for these tests that show me it is still working in all spots encountered!
      so these tests are allowing me to reduce a ton of time I'd spend finding patterns upfront and then testing them manually...
      instead, minimal pattern criteria until I have test cases otherwise
