Focus on the code near <|fim_middle|>\nDo NOT explain your decisions. Do NOT return markdown blocks ```\nONLY return valid code at the <|fim_middle|> position\nPAY attention to existing whitespace. Especially on the cursor line!\nYOU ARE ONLY INSERTING CODE. DO NOT REPEAT PREFIX. DO NOT REPEAT SUFFIX.\nComplete as little or as much code as is necessary to help the user. That means part of a line, a full line or even multiple lines! Goal is to help the user as much as is possible and reasonable.\n\nHere are a few examples of tricky completions:\n\n## Example: suggest middle of line (cursor has existing code before and after it)\n\n```python\ndef area(width, height):\n    return <|fim_middle|> * height\n```\n\nSay this is your desired result:\n```python\ndef area(width, height):\n    return width * height\n```\n\n1. thent he CORRECT completion is (do not include backticks, those are just to delimit included whitespace):\n`width`\n\n2. WRONG (because repeats the suffix):\n`width * height`\nresults in:\n`    return width * height * height`\n\n3. WRONG (because repeats both suffix and prefix):\n`    return width * height`\nresults in:\n`    return     return width * height * height`\n\n\n## Example: cursor is indented\n\n```lua\nfunction print_sign(number)\n    if number > 0 then\n        print(\"Positive\")\n    <|fim_middle|>\n    end\nend\n```\n\n*Keep in mind, the indent will be there before the suggested code too.*\n\nSay this is your desired result:\n```lua\nfunction print_sign(number)\n    if number > 0 then\n        print(\"Positive\")\n    else\n        print(\"Non‑positive\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n1. then the CORRECT completion is:\n```lua\nelse\n        print(\"Non‑positive\")\n```\n\n2. WRONG (`else` ends up double indented when it should be single):\n```lua\n    else\n        print(\"Non‑positive\")\n```\nresults in:\n```lua\nfunction print_sign(number)\n    if number > 0 then\n        print(\"Positive\")\n        else\n        print(\"Non‑positive\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.
