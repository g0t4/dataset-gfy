standard issue, repeat some other code for a slightly different context right next to completed code
in this case STDOUT/STDERR output length check

Also note a stellar completion on the part of gptoss, after I put the warnings/notices about cursor line into the prompt, it's been generating much better completions w/o repeating surrounding context nearly as often
