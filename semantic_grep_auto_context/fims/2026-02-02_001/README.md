OMFG this is incredible
- it computed the correct frame numbers that were missing...
    and the input wasn't frame numbers, it was timestamps?!

FTR a few times after this it struggled to get this right

ALSO, incredible to me... I just added dropped_frames.py and tests .... and the RAG matches are all from the corresponding dropped_frames.py file! SO GODDAMN COOL
