just love it! => again, I just refactored to this new helper that can accept other fields beyond STDOUT and this was my first non STDOUT usage!

TODO => reminder that I still get the occasional duplication of entire line when filling in just the middle and don't want start/end repeated
- that said, it rarely happens compared to my first iterations of gptoss for FIM
