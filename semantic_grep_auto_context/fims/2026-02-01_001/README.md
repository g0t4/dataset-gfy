FIM can generate a full file ;)
- code was all valid, a bit odd with tolerance, but when I changed tolerance to the frame rate (just above it)..
  and I set "pkt_pts_time" => "pts_time" ... there is no pkt_pts_time (that would be pkt_dts_time)
  then it worked to find gaps!

incredible FIM output actually!
