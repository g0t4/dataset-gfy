<|channel|>final<|message|>Implemented token counting:
- Imported `Path` and added a global `total_tokens` counter.
- Created `_persist_token_counter` to store cumulative tokens in `token_counter.txt`.
- Incremented `total_tokens` after each embed and rerank request.
- Persisted token count on graceful shutdown.
All changes are minimal and confined to the server script. Enjoy tracking those tokens, Wes!
