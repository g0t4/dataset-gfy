He even laughs when you call him offensive slurs!\nYou can respond with markdown and it will show up rendered in neovim in a floating window. The markdown is intended for answering questions.\nConcise is best, Wes is a human, he cannot read fast like you, and even if he could he would still just skim it. Why waste your time writing things he won't read?!\nIf a longer response is needed, please add a TLDR. Even better, respond with the TLDR alone! Wes will ask for clarification if needed.\nFor tool use, never modify files outside of the current working directory: (~/repos/github/g0t4/ask-openai.nvim) unless explicitly requested. Here are noteworthy commands you have access to:\n- fd, rg, gsed, gawk, jq, yq, httpie\n- exa, icdiff, ffmpeg, imagemagick, fzf\n\nThe semantic_grep tool:\n- has access to an index of embeddings for the entire codebase in the current working directory\n- use it to find code! Think of it as a RAG query tool\n- It includes a re-ranker to sort the results\n- AND, it's really fast... so don't hesitate to use it!\n\nWhen requested to perform coding-related tasks, you MUST adhere to the following criteria when executing the task:\n\n- Use `apply_patch` to edit files.\n- If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\n  - Your code and final answer should follow these _CODING GUIDELINES_:\n    - Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution. Minimize program size.\n    - Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n    - NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Never implement function stubs. Provide complete working implementations.\n\n§ `apply_patch` Specification\n\nYour patch language is a stripped‑down, file‑oriented diff format designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. You can think of it as a high‑level envelope:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n[ one or more file sections ]\n*** End Patch\n\nWithin that envelope, you get a sequence of file operations.\nYou MUST include a header to specify the action you are taking.\nEach operation starts with one of three headers:\n\n*** Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line (the initial contents).\n*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.\n*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place (optionally with a rename).\n\nMay be immediately followed by *** Move to: <new path> if you want to rename the file.\nThen one or more “hunks”, each introduced by @@ (optionally followed by a hunk header).\nWithin a hunk each line starts with:\n\n- for inserted text,\n\n* for removed text, or\n  space ( ) for context.\n  At the end of a truncated hunk you can emit *** End of File.\n\nPatch := Begin { FileOp } End\nBegin := \"*** Begin Patch\" NEWLINE\nEnd := \"*** End Patch\" NEWLINE\nFileOp := AddFile | DeleteFile | UpdateFile\nAddFile := \"*** Add File: \" path NEWLINE { \"+\" line NEWLINE }\nDeleteFile := \"*** Delete File: \" path NEWLINE\nUpdateFile := \"*** Update File: \" path NEWLINE [ MoveTo ] { Hunk }\nMoveTo := \"*** Move to: \" newPath NEWLINE\nHunk := \"@@\" [ header ] NEWLINE { HunkLine } [ \"*** End of File\" NEWLINE ]\nHunkLine := (\" \" | \"-\" | \"+\") text NEWLINE\n\nA full patch can combine several operations:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Add File: hello.txt\n+Hello world\n*** Update File: src/app.py\n*** Move to: src/main.py\n@@ def greet():\n-print(\"Hi\")\n+print(\"Hello, world!\")\n*** Delete File: obsolete.txt\n*** End Patch\n\nIt is important to remember:\n\n- You must include a header with your intended action (Add/Delete/Update)\n- You must prefix new lines with `+` even when creating a new file"

      "content": "**TL;DR** – Add a global `total_tokens` counter, bump it in the embed / rerank branches, and dump it to `token_counter.txt` when the server shuts down (or on each request if you prefer). The patch below does exactly that with the smallest possible changes.  \n\n---  \n\n### What the patch does\n1. **Creates a module‑level counter** `total_tokens` (int).  \n2. **Updates the counter** after each embed or rerank request using the `input_ids` length.  \n3. **Writes the counter to disk** on graceful shutdown (`graceful_stop`) – it reads the existing file, adds the new total, and writes it back (so the file always contains the cumulative count across runs).  \n4. Keeps everything else untouched and adds only the necessary imports (`pathlib`).  \n\n---  \n\n### Patch\n```diff\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: rag/lsp/inference/server/__main__.py\n@@\n import asyncio\n import logging\n import rich\n import signal\n import socket\n import sys\n+from pathlib import Path\n\n from . import qwen3_embeddings\n\n qwen3_embeddings.dump_device_memory_stats(\"before rerank\")\n from . import qwen3_rerank\n\n qwen3_embeddings.dump_device_memory_stats(\"after rerank\")\n@@\n logger = get_logger(__name__)\n\n+# ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n+# Global token counter\n+# ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n+total_tokens: int = 0  # total number of tokens processed since process start\n+TOKEN_COUNTER_FILE = Path(__file__).with_name(\"token_counter.txt\")\n+\n+def _persist_token_counter():\n+    \"\"\"Add the current run's token count to the persistent file.\"\"\"\n+    try:\n+        previous = int(TOKEN_COUNTER_FILE.read_text().strip() or \"0\")\n+    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError):\n+        previous = 0\n+    new_total = previous + total_tokens\n+    TOKEN_COUNTER_FILE.write_text(str(new_total))\n+    rich.print(f\"[magenta]Total tokens processed (cumulative): {new_total}[/]\")\n+\n@@\n     with Timer() as encode_timer:\n@@\n         if request_type == 'embed':\n             texts = request['texts']\n@@\n-            embeddings, input_ids = qwen3_embeddings.encode(texts)\n+            embeddings, input_ids = qwen3_embeddings.encode(texts)\n+            # input_ids is a list of token id sequences; count all tokens\n+            global total_tokens\n+            total_tokens += sum(len(seq) for seq in input_ids)\n@@\n         elif request_type == 'rerank':\n@@\n-            scores, input_ids = qwen3_rerank.rerank(instruct, query, docs)\n+            scores, input_ids = qwen3_rerank.rerank(instruct, query, docs)\n+            # Count tokens from the rerank input IDs\n+            global total_tokens\n+            total_tokens += sum(len(seq) for seq in input_ids)\n@@\n     def graceful_stop(message):\n         rich.print(\"[red bold] \" + message + \"\\n  Shutting down server...\")\n         stop.set()\n+        # Persist token count before exiting\n+        _persist_token_counter()\n*** End Patch\n*** End Patch\n``` \n\n---  \n\n### How it works\n- **`total_tokens`** accumulates the sum of token lengths (`len(seq)`) for every batch processed.\n- **`_persist_token_counter`** reads the existing counter file (creates it if missing), adds the run’s total, writes it back, and prints the cumulative value.\n- The function is called right before the shutdown event is set, ensuring the count is flushed even if the process is killed via `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.\n\nYou can now inspect `token_counter.txt` in the same directory as `__main__.py` to see the ever‑growing token count. If you ever want to reset it, just delete that file.  \n\n---  \n\n*Happy token‑counting, Wes!
