return early refactoring... requires flipping if conditions... and that is always an opportunity to make a logic mistake
- but, the logic is often very straightforward for an LLM to get right, so just rely on the LLM
- again, this helps me think about WHAT I want my code to look like and less on the steps to get it from A to B
