loop changes, in a split second!

## 1769591127-thread.json
first loop change, gave it full file, does really well with that context

## 1769592396-thread.json
second modification, did not give it full file, just selection and RAG matches (and RAG matches cannot be same file, so it's kinda flying blind)...
 and that blindness manifests in an annoyance:
   ... hasattr when that attr is always there!
       that said that might not be obvious based on the code selection alone
