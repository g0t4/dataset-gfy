requested gptoss120b medium reasoning effort to reduce duplication between 6 functions as much as possible:

```vim
:AskRewrite extract a shared function that eliminates most of the duplicate code b/w these functions
```

- `attempt1` was good but left some dupliation around half page which was odd b/c it had designed the scale factor well for all other cases!
- `attempt2` it got it (after reset to original code too, IOTW from same start point)

I just assumed I need a higher reasoning effort to pull this off, but I should try lower too
