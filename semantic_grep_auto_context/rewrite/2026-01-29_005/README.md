I absolutely love that I have no idea how to do it in jest, but I can imagine this is possible... detect jest when running and if so don't always_log... that way I don't emit confusing errors in testing that are unrelated to tests passing/failing...
- I imagine, it generates the code... isn't it more valuable to know what should be doable than it is to recall exactly how to do smth? or spend an hour searching for this?
