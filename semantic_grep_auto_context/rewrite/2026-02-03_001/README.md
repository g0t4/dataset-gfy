love this type of timesaver!


only issue here is that the model didn't rewrite everything and instead rewrote two separate code blocks and skipped _FakeCP...
not too bad to apply and then use git to merge the parts I want and revert effectively removing _FakeCP
- nonetheless would be nice if it did the full chunk always, it can use comments and blocks for other parts of files it rewrites too
  *but the selected code needs fully rewritten and missing = removed*
