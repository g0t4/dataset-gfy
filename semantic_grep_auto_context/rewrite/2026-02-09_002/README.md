basically do the man page lookup for me :)
- I can't recall if I've ever used the prefill on query in fzf, so I just asked the model to do it for me

TODO => revisit why the damn model keeps touching unrelated code :)... it has an obsession with stupid, small changes like `-l` for local variables when that has no meaningful impact in a function where that is the default! (other than making it explicit in the code)
