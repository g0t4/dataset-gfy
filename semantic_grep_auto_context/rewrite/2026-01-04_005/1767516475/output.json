Probably there is existing _pan_x_by_factor in plot_helpers. We need to extract common logic into a function like _pan_y_by_factor or _pan_y_by_shift. Provide code changes accordingly, preserving indentation and not adding comments.\n\nWe need to locate existing _pan_x_by_factor function. Not provided, but we assume it's defined similarly: takes event and factor? Let's guess structure:\n\ndef _pan_x_by_factor(event: KeyEvent, factor: float):\n    cur = plotter.get_x_limits()\n    shift = cur.width * factor\n    plotter.set_x_limits(cur.start + shift, cur.end + shift)\n\nMaybe. For y, we need similar with cur.height.\n\nImplement function _pan_y_by_factor(event: KeyEvent, factor: float) and then have pan_up and pan_down call it with appropriate factor (+0.1 and -0.1). Ensure naming snake_case.\n\nAdd function before pan_up/down definitions.\n\nProvide only code modifications.\n\nWe need to preserve unrelated code; just add function and modify pan_up/down bodies to call it.\n\nThus output code snippet with function and updated pan_up/down.\n\nNo comments."}
