The snippet: \"occurence\" should be \"occurrence\". Also maybe \"instances\" is redundant: \"every occurrence of text\". Also \"double check\" maybe \"double-check\". Also maybe grammar: \"while embeddings are great for finding relevant code, if you need to find every occurrence of text, make sure to double-check with a command like `rg`\". Also \"embedding\" maybe singular? But likely they want to correct spelling.\n\nWe need to output corrected code, preserving indentation. It's a markdown file; code block language \"lua/ask-openai/questions/prompts/tools.md\"? That's weird; but we just need to output the corrected line.\n\nThus output:\n\n```lua/ask-openai/questions/prompts/tools.md\n- while embeddings are great for finding relevant code, if you need to find every occurrence of text, make sure to double‑check with a command like `rg`\n```\n\nPreserve indentation.
