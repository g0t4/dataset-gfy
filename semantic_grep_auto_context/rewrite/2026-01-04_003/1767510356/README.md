ok suggestion, but it nuked my comments... I need to get it to stop that unless I ask to have them removed
- TODO look into where your guidance on no comments is at... might be a conflict b/w developer message and user messages
    OK yeah... User message #2 in this thread mentions perserving unrelated comments, I should move that to dev message only or also... And see if it stops nuking unrelated comments... in fact I would prefer it leave comments along unless I explicitly ask to have them removed
