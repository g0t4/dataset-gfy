    "reasoning_content":"We need to produce fish shell code preferences analogous to the Lua preferences described. Should follow the user's request: \"think of the same ideas but how I would want them in fish shell scripts\". Provide a new file with fish shell code preferences. Should preserve indentation (though it's a new file). Should not add extra comments at end of lines, no stupid comments. Provide code only (no explanations). So we output a markdown code block with file path maybe? The user gave a path .config/ask-openai/context/filetypes/fish.md. We should produce fish preferences similar to naming, type hints (fish doesn't have types, but maybe we can talk about documentation/comments). Provide guidelines: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes? fish doesn't have classes, but maybe we can talk about using capitalized for custom commands? Provide example of function definitions and usage, comment style. Use functions with `function name` and `end`. Use meaningful variable names, extract ambiguous conditions into variables. Provide example of extracting condition variable. Provide example of documentation with fish's `#` comments, maybe use docstring style.\n\nWe should not add explanations outside code. Just provide the preferences in fish markdown file. The user wants code, not prose. So we produce a fish.md file content with bullet points, code examples. That's acceptable as code? It's a markdown file with comments? Probably okay. Provide as a code block with the file path as heading.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n```.config/ask-openai/context/filetypes/fish.md\nNaming\n- Use snake_case for functions and variables.\n- Use PascalCase for custom commands or modules.\n\nCondition extraction\n- When a condition is ambiguous, assign it to a well‑named variable before the `if`.\n\nExamples:\nfunction process_names --argument-names names checker\n    # ambiguous condition\n    set -l is_blank_line (string match -r '^\\s*$' \"$line\")\n    if test $is_blank_line\n        # ...\n    end\nend\n\n# Documentation style\n# @param names string[] - list of names\n# @param checker function - takes a name and returns boolean\n# @return table<string, integer>\nfunction process_names --argument-names names checker\n    # implementation\nend\n```\n\nMake sure indentation preserved. Provide code block only.",
