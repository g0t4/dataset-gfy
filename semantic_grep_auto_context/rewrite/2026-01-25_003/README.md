playing around with test clarity by changing how you assert outputs... that matters alot when it comes to trusting tests and trusting code does what you think
... i.e. previuosly I wasn't aware of some stuff the model was NOT seeing!

Anyways, the ability to issue a quick prompt and have the code rewritten (saving minutes of time)... and then I can focus my time on reflecting on if the new format feels right...
- that is incredibly valuable for testing
- snap fingers and the assertions are changed... can do that repeatedly until you get just the right setup

love that it knows how to map contains vs exact match...
- I probably would've neve realized this was possible...
  instead I'd avoid tests w/o contains matches
  or maybe even give up on this array/object style assertion if enough need the contains operation
