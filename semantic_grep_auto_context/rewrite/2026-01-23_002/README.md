select some code (minimal contex, a few lines of code)...
ask to change it
w/o RAG matches, this wouldn't work
with RAG matches, it's incredible! FAST TOO (very small prompt)

note RAG matches here were for other consumers using the same crossover critical points to build a string message, not the RmsPoint type... which makes sense here given I am selecting code that is using croossovers primarily
