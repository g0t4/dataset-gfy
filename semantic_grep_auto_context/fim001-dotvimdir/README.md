wowsers, I was writing notes about a new dotvimdir feature in my werkspaces plugin and gptoss wrote the entire thing for me (I didn't write any of the code)... yes there appears to be a duplication of my logic to find the werkspace dir... I don't care... this worked on the first run in my auto_edit repo where I had a .vim/init.lua setup to print a test message! I didn't even mention the pathing to the file to load this from... cool!


btw there wasn't any help from RAG, so, I put this as just a cool FIM example... notably a LONG suggestion
