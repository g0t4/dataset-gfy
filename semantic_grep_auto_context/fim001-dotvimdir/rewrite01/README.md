this was intentional! I specifically mentioned werkspaces functionality to get the workspace root... I didn't recall the module/function to used... but I knew RAG would hit it, likely top 1 result and yeah... it did, result #1!


for perspective, during AskRewrite, only what I type (the user message) is used to pull in relevant code... in this case this was the extent of my request:

:AskRewrite have this use my werkspaces plugin to get the workspace directory that way, so that it's consistent

and of course, I selected the spot and code I wanted changed (the line that was modified)

embeddings are special!
