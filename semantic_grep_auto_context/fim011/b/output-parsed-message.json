  "reasoning_content": "We need to insert assertions similar to earlier. Likely check rms and seconds etc. Look at MinMeasures fields used earlier. For first_min on frame, they want rms value? Probably compute expected rms = -20? In gap down 147 from -20 start? initial left speech at -20? Actually start(-20).down(147) means ramp from -20 down 147 hops => final rms = -20 -147 = -167? But not sure. Simpler: just assert window.first_min.rms == -20 - 147? Might be too specific. Perhaps they only assert frame aligned and seconds already done, then also check rms and seconds? Probably check rms equals -20 - 147? I'll output generic asserts: assert window.first_min.rms == -20 - 147 and window.first_min.seconds approx etc already. Provide those two lines."
