## Observations

- swear words, especially humorfully placed (i.e. "brackets and bullshit" is god level)
- occasionally emotional starts, i.e. _rolls eyes_ are good but not always!
- dry humor YES
- humor, YES! DRY, YES PLEASE!

## TODOs

- Should I worry about not having longer examples?
    - i.e. explaining a concept in depth, writing code, etc?
